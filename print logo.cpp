This Python script reads an HTML file named `example.html` and prints out each paragraph within
the `<p>` tags found in the document. The function `read_html()` is used to open and read the search results page,  that file, one at a time. The script that document.

The function `read_html()` is the `<p>` tags found in that file.
the `<p>` tags found in the document. The `read_html()` function is used to read the contents of  
the specified file, which returns a string containing the entire HTML content.  
The `find_paragraphs()` function takes this HTML as input and uses regular expressions  
to locate all occurrences of opening `<p>` tags (`<p>`) followed by any number of non-closing  
tags (e.g., text or other elements), followed by a closing `</p>` tag. It then appends these    
matches into a list called `paras`, returning that list.  
Finally, the script iterates over each match in `paras` using a loop , printing each one incoming match and returning the matching  result.

    def : function(file) -> None
        print_paragraphs(read_html(file), find_paragraphs)

In the main section of the code, we call `print_paragraphs()`, passing it two arguments: 
1.  The result of calling `read_html(file)`, which contains the HTML from the file. 
2.  The `find_paragraphs()` function itself, which will be applied to the HTML contained in     
    the first argument.

Finally, if you run this program with no command line arguments, it will prompt for a filename.
You can also specify a filename on the command line like so: 

    python extractor.py example.html

If your system doesn't support running scripts directly, you may need to use a shell
script or batch file to invoke the interpreter and pass the filename.  For example,
on Windows systems, you might create a file named "run.bat" containing the following:

    @echo off
    python extractor.py %*

Then you could run the program using the command:

    run example.html
